      <p>Hey there!

        My name is Tan and I would like to thank you for visiting Tans Giftshop.

        I opened this little shop on the 16th June 2014, it was a magnificent day!

        My fully sustainable operation is based in beautiful Tofino, a small fishing village in British Columbia, Canada.

        A great deal of my merchandise consists of local products from various artists in the area

        In addition I stock a carefully curated range of clothing, accessories and gifts which I buy myself at fair-trade prices from weavers and craftspeople in Thailand and Nepal.

        When selecting stock I always source high quality (which means long-lasting) materials as well as unique designs. Every piece has a story to tell.

    <h4>Love Tofino</h4>
    <p>Tofino is located on the west coast of Vancouver IslandAt the head of Clayoquot Sound inlet. And basically it's great. Surrounded by huge cedar forests full of healthy wildlife and long windswept coasts empty of tourists. Tofino is also home to abundant sea-life, seals, otters, clams... we spend half the year eating freshly caught salmon. So yeah, whether you've lived here all your life, or just stopped over for the summer everyone whose been here can agree that Tofino is a place whose ruggedness and beauty strike a chord directly to the heart. Or at least that's what I think. It's why I put my shop here.</p>
